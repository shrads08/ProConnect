# ProConnect - A Professional Networking Platform
-------------------------------------------------------

# Overview
Welcome to the Professional Networking Platform project! This project aims to address existing issues in professional networking by providing a comprehensive solution for professionals to connect, collaborate, and grow in their profession.

# Problem Statement
Following are some of the issues with the professional networking.

- Limited customization options for user profiles.
- Lack of quality connections.
- Lack of comprehensive and statistical guidance on employer's offerings.
- Poor user experience and interface design.
- Ineffective job search / referral options.
- Spam messages

# Solution
A platform is envisioned where individuals can establish their professional profiles and connect with others within their industry or area of professional interest. This platform would also facilitate job searching and application processes.

The platform ensures comprehensive and up-to-date job listings. Additionally, users have the advantage of requesting referrals from employees of companies they are interested in. Points are earned when a referral request is made and even for accepting referral requests, which can later be redeemed for learning courses.

Moreover, users have the option to access statistical insights regarding an employer's offerings.

Lastly, the platform offers users the ability to control the receipt of advertisement or marketing-related messages, allowing them to disable or enable such communications to prevent spam messages.
